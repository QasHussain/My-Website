# [My Junior Front End Development Porfolio Website](https://qasimh-dev.com)

### By Qasim Hussain

## Description

My online portfolio website. I built this website to act as my online CV when applying for front end development jobs. This project was degined in Figma and built in react using javascript, node.js and sass. I set out to make a website that was sleek, lightweight, and stylish as wekk as fully responsive and compatible on for all devices.

## Planning and Preperation

As with my previous project, the planning and preparation for this website involved a lot of design work in Figama. I searched the internet for websites that I liked to draw inspiration from before I went into Figma and started designing my project. I knew I wanted a single page application that was clear and intuitive.

Using Figma I designed the landing page, main content and a separate 'development process' page for my portfolio project that would highlight all the steps I took when building my Final Fantasy Codex application:

## Fully Responsive Design

When planning this project I always knew I wanted a fully responsive design compatible with all devices, so I also created mobile designs for the above pages.

With all the design work completed, I began the build. Given the single page, reactive nature of this website I knew I wanted to use the React Library. The work I did designing this website once again proved vital, as I was able to build this website with a clear vision in mind, a vision I believe was brought to life succesfully.
