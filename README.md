# My Front End Porfolio Website

### By Qasim Hussain

## Description

My online portfolio website. I built this website to display to act as my online CV when applying for fton end development jobs. This project was degined in Figma and built in react using javascript, node.js and sass. I set out to make a website that was sleek, lightweight, and stylish that would also be fully responsive and compatible on for all devices.

## Planning and Preperation

As with my previous prject, the planning and preparation for this website involved a lot of design work in Figama. I search the internet for websites that I liked to draw inspiration from before I went into Figma and started designing my website. I knew I wanted it to a single page application that was clear and intuitive.

Using Figma I designed the landing page, main content and a separate 'development process' page for my portfolio project that would highlight all the steps I took when building my Final Fnatasy Codex application:

## Fully Responsive Design

When planning this project I always knew I wanted a fully responsive design compatible with all devices, so I also created mobile designs for the above pages.

With all the design work completed, i began the built. Given the single page, reactive nature of this website I knew I wanted to use the React Library. The work I did designing this website once again proved vital, as I was able to build this website with a clear vision in mind, a vision I believe was brought to life succesfully.
