            Final Fantasy Codex is an online, fully responsive interactive
            encyclopedia of every character in the mainline Final Fantasy video
            game series entries 6 through 15.

            This project was degined and built for my front-end development
            portfolio. As a long time fan of the Final Fantasy series, I wanted
            to create something different, something truly unique and personal
            to me for my first portfolio piece. I also wanted to challenge
            myself by making an API heavy application with multiple endpoints
            that looked smooth, intuitive and stylish.

            The next step was to start coding and building the application. Due
            to the single page and reactive nature of the application I wanted
            to build, I knew the React library would be ideal for this project.
          </p>
          <p className="designDescription__text">
            I believe the work I did in planning and preparing the app was
            vital. This is a very API heavy application with a lot of endpoints,
            so I am proud that I was able to build the application that remained
            almost completely faithful to the Figma designs, as well as the
            visual and functional goals I set when planning this project.
